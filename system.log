Testing Interface: Take Drop Tiles and Particles
Tile is not in the world
Take particle
particle with particle id 19a7f173-870e-48e7-acf5-2ea8c3da97ca  has been taken
No tile taken for dropping
particle cannot be  taken
Is not possible to drop the particle on that position
Tile cannot taken because particle is carrieng either a tile or a particle
Tile cannot taken because particle is carrieng either a tile or a particle
Is not possible to drop the particle on that position because it is occupied
particle cannot be  taken
Particle succesfull dropped
particle with particle id d304b764-38a7-4c5e-afd2-3bcf2f4020bf is in the world
particle with particle id d304b764-38a7-4c5e-afd2-3bcf2f4020bf  has been taken
Particle succesfull dropped
