Before the ORN Simulator can be started, its simulation world has to be created.
At lease one particle should be created that takse the action of the world.
For creating a particle just create a python file e.g. one_particle_world.py
in the folder robtotsOnTiles/worlds/ and insert the  following code:


def create_world(self):

	self.add_particle(0,0)


That is all and you created a particle.
